    "Maximum Weight Independent Set Problem Statement:\n",
    " - Input - a path graph (i.e. path from one node to another basically; like a line) G = (V, E) with nonnegative weights on vertices \n",
    " - Output - independent set i.e. a subset of the graph's vertices so that no two vertices that are adjacent with maximum total weight\n",
    "     - With path, avoiding consecutive vertices p much\n",
    "\n",
    "What paradigms do we have so far? Consdier path with weights 1, 4, 5, 4\n",
    " - Brute Force - iterate through all independent sents, remembering the one with maximum total weight. Requires exponential time (even in path graph)\n",
    " - Greedy - pick point with highest value; only pick if not adjacent/consecutive with any already chose\n",
    "     - But, not always correct. For example path, will produce 6. Correct is 8. No other real approach\n",
    " - Divide and Conquer - Break path into two paths, recursively compute max weight independent set in each\n",
    "     - But, may produce things with consecutive points. For top, break into 2 halves. 1st half pick 4, 2nd pick 5. In big graph, very difficult to repair for feasible and optimal solution\n",
    "     - There are some solutions that exist in quadratic time, but not optimal at all\n",
    " - Dynamic - Will solve problem in O(n)"

    "Critical step: Reason about structure of an optimal soution. In terms of optimal solutions of smaller subproblems. \n",
    " - This experiment narrows down the set of candidates for the optimal solution; can search through small set using brute-force-search\n",
    " - Can reason about the object trying to compute i.e., if I had an optimal solution, what could I say about it?\n",
    " - Notation: Let S be the vertcies in a Max-Weight Independent Set; Vn = last node of the input graph\n",
    " \n",
    "Case Analysis  - Vn is either in S or not in S.\n",
    " - Case 1: Vn not in S, let G' = G\n",
    "     - S is also an IS of G'. S must also be optimal of G'; if S* (a diff one) was better ,it would be better than S in G as well [contradiction]\n",
    " - Case 2: Vn is in S; then previous vertex Vn-1 not in S. Let G'' = G with Vn-1 and Vn deleted\n",
    "     - S - Vn is an optimal IS of G''. If S* - Vn was  optimal in G'' and not S, then S* with Vn would be better than S in G [contradiction again]\n",
    "     \n",
    "Towards an Algorithm:\n",
    " - Above, we see that the optimal solution must exclude last verte and is nothing more than max weight IS of G' or, if includes last vertex, msut be MWIS of G'' augmented with this last vertex Vn. \n",
    " - Corollary: If we knew whether or not Vn was in the MWIS,  could recursively compute the MWIS of G' and G''. But, do not know if Vn in optimal solution\n",
    "     - So, can try both possibilities and return the better solution. But, lmfao, this is recursive organization of brute force search. Need to elim redundancy to improve implementation time. "

    " - Identify a small number of subproblems (e.g. compute MWIS of Gi for i to n)\n",
    "     - Best acse, each subproblem solved in constant time. So, # of subproblems is lower-bound on running time p much. \n",

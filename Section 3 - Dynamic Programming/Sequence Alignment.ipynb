    "     - Analyze alingment by summing up penalties of flaws i.e. per gap and per mismatch.\n",
    " - Input: Strings X = x1,x2,x3...xn; Y = y1,y2,y3...yn over same alphabet Sigma. \n",
    "     - Penalty of Agap >= 0 for insreting a gap, Agap for matching a and b (so if a = b, Aab = 0)\n",
    " - Feasible Solutions - alignments i.e. insert gaps t equalize lengths of the strings\n",

    "             - Induced alignment here is an alignment of X' and Y', this alignment is optimal. \n",
    "         - If Case 2 holds, final position includes only xm. So, induced alignment missing character xm.\n",
    "             - Case 2 holds, then induced alignment of X', Y is optimal (since Y not missing anything)\n",
    "         - If Case 3 holds, then induced alignment of X, Y' is optimal (by reasoning above)\n",
    "         \n",
    "Optimal Substructure Proof:\n",
    " - Proof of Case 1 (other cases are similar) by contradiction:\n",
    "     - Suppose induced alignment of X', Y' has penalty P while some other alignment has penalty P* < P. If that were true, could \"lift\" this alignment of X', Y' to X and Y. \n",
    "         - i.e., Use this P* alignment, append xn - yn to this new alignment. Get an alignment of X, Y ith penalty P* + alpha(xm,yn) < P + alph(xm, yn). But, this contradicts purported optimality of X,Y as stated in beginning of optimal structure. "

    "Empty-Cut Lemma - a graph is not connected iff there exists cutt (A,B) with no crossing edges. \n",
    " - 2 part proof: Assuming 1st statement, then can prove second. Then, assuming 2nd, can prove first. Bc is iff statement.\n",
    " - Assume the 1st statement. Pick ny u in A and v in B. \n",
    "     - Since no edges cross A and B, there is no u to v path in G. Thus, G is not connectd. \n",
    " - Assume the 2nd statement. Suppose G has no u to v path. \n",
    "     - Define A = vertices reachable from A. u is in A by definition. A is u's connected component basically.\n",
    "     - B = all other vertices (i.e. all other connected components). v in B. \n",
    "     - Note, no crossing edges at (A,B). If there did exist path A to B, bc u can reach everything in A, u would be able to reach whatever reached from that path. That's a contradiction. So, must be true. \n",
    " - So, graph is disconnected iff above; connected iff A B have crossing edges. \n",
    " \n",
    "Double-Crossing Lemma - Suppose the there exists a cycle C in E. E has an edge crossing the cut A,B. Then, so does some other edge of C. \n",
    " - Fairly obvious. If there is an edge that connects points u, v in A, B. Since on cycle, must cross the cuts an even number of times. Remember, cycle starts and ends at same point. \n",

    "Proof of Original Claim:\n",

    " - Cannot get stuck with X != V i.e. spans all vertices (so T spans all V). \n",
    "     - With the while loop, will not end as long as X != V. Only thing that can go wrong is if no edges on frontier of X connecting to V.\n",
    "     - If that were the case, the cut (X, V-X) must be empty i.e. no crossing edges. Then, via empty cut lemme, input graph G is disconnected\n",

    "     - e is the first edge crossing (X, V-X) that gets added to T. No edges thus far cross X, V-X. \n",
    "     - e must be an edge that crosses the cuts (by def in algorithm). So, when e added to T, will be lonely. By Lonely Cut Corollary, cannot possibly be in a cycle. \n",

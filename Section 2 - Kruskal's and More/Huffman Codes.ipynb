    "\n",
    "Example: Encoding {A,B,C,D}, can encode as {0, 10, 110, 111). So, no code is a \"prefix\" of any other. This can take advantage of non-uniform frequences in an alphabet.\n",

    "Useful Fact: Binary codes are basically binary trees.\n",
    " - EX: Sigma = {A,B,C,D}. Fixed length: Each char of alphabet is leaf in the final tree. Root to Leaf path gives it the encoding. 0 is Left, 1 is Right. A = 00, B = 01, C = 10, D = 11. \n",
    " - With variable encoding (not prefix-free), A = 0, B = 01. So, at first 0, A is at that node. Then going to 1 from there, goes to B. Ambiguity is where you have internal nodes of the tree (i.e. where A is).  \n",
    " - Prefix-Free Code: Not perfectly balanced tree, will only have lables at leaves of the tree. Can draw out A = 0, B = 10, C = 110, D = 111. Each bit goes down one layer of tree. \n",
    " \n",
    "General Idea:\n",
    " - For each i in Sigma, exactly one node is labeled \"i\"\n",
    " - Encoding of each i is bits along path from root to the node \"i\".\n",
    " - Prefix-Free iff labeled nodes = the leaves. (Prefixes means one node is ancester of another).\n",
    " - To decode: Start at root, when see 0, go left, see 1, go right. Whenever find a leaf, returns i for that leaf. Then start at root again. \n",

    " - Let C1, C2,.. Ck = greedy clustering with spacing S\n",
    " - Let C1.hat, C2.hat...Ck.hat = some arbitrary other clustering\n",
    " - Need to show that otherclustering spacing is <= S\n",

    " - Case 2: Otherwise, can find a point pair p, q such that:\n",
    "     - p, q in the same greedyc luster Ci, and:\n",
    "     - p, q in different lusters Ci.hat, Cj.hat\n",
    "         - Property of Greedy - If 2 pairs, x,y, directly merged at some point, then d(x,y) <= S. Distance between merged point pairs only goes up. This bc Greedy picks smallest distance and merges, effectively deleting from consideration. S is the largest distance of 2 points NOT merged. \n",
    "     - Easy Case: If p,q directly merged at some point, Spacing of C.hats <= d(p,q) <= S. \n",
    "         - Bc p,q in different C.hats, they are separated by the C.hats and therefore the upper bound the spacing ofthe C hats. \n",
    "     - Tricky Case: p,q \"indirectly merged\" through multiple direct merges of points in respective clusters. \n",
    "         - Let p, a, a1, a2...al,q be the path of direct greedy mergers connecting p and q\n",
    "         - Since p in Ci.hat, q not in Ci.hat. There must be some consecutive pair ai, ai+1 with ai in Ci.hat, ai+1 not in Ci.hat. Now, effectively, instead of comparing p and q, can compair ai and ai+1. \n",
    "         - S >= d(ai, ai+1) >= spacing of C.hats. \n",
    "             - This is basically back in easy case. ai and ai+1 directly merged in Greedy since p and q are in same cluster. "

    "Motivation: Greedy algorithm may be good enough and extremely fast. \n",
    " - Consider order of items where, adding in item in order (permanent decision) would be good enough.\n",
    " - Ideal items have good value to weight ratio. (Think back to scheduling problem, want high weight to be first, want high length last. Looked at job ratios).\n",
    "     - Knapsack: Sort and reindex items by value/weight, highest to lowest. \n",
    " - Pack items in this order. Problem is, at a certain point, Knapsack will be full. Once one doesn't fit, then close program\n",
    "     - In truth, can keep looking at next items for those that have smaller weights (even if less efficient). Will run through entire list until weight of S = W. However, do not worry about this for now. \n",
    "     - Example: v1 = 2, w1 = 1. v2 = 4, w2 = 3. v3 = 3, w3 = 3. W = 5\n",
    "     - Packs 1, Packs 2, 3 doesn't fit. So, solution gives (1, 2) with total value 6. Indeed optimal.  \n",

    "     - Greedy will return (1); optimal solution will return (2). 2nd item ratio worse but fills whole knapsack with better value.\n",
    " - So, greedy solution can be arbitrarily bad relative to an optimal solution. Add step 3 to heuristic.\n",
    "     - Return either Step-2 solution or the maximum valuable item, which ever is better. i.e., does check. ooks at each item individually, if item dominates solution computed so far, return that single item. Transforms greedy heuristic into a reasonably good worst-case guarantee.\n",

    " - What if we were allowed to fill fully the knapsak using a suitable \"fration\" (like 70%) of item k + 1 (the value of which is \"pro-rated\")\n",
